      <title>TIL: January 2020</title>

      <description>Back in August 2018 I started the habit of writing down stuff I learn. I had come across a lot of TIL posts on reddit, which inspired me to start building a library of personal knowledge.
Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve had some months on and off, some more documented than others. I keep a TIL list in my Workflowy that I like to refer back to.
This year I&amp;rsquo;d like to become better at taking notes of the random facts, computer tricks and techniques I run across.</description>

      <description>tl;dr My friend and I made a roguelike named Skyspire. It&amp;rsquo;s our first roguelike, and first game in a long while. You can find the code on Github.
A week ago I decided to do a 7DRL Challenge. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with different game engines since middle school, but I tend to start projects without finishing. I read about the 7DRL concept some time last year, and I figured it seemed like a good idea to actually get to something playable.</description>
